## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ **Image Data**

* All images are listed in `script.js`, with `src` and `category`.
* Categories match filter buttons.

### 2️⃣ **Filtering**

* Click filter buttons to show only images in that category.
* "All" resets the filter.

### 3️⃣ **Pagination**

* Configurable images per page (default 20).
* Prev/Next buttons to navigate pages.
* Disabled automatically at first/last page.

### 4️⃣ **Masonry Layout**

* Uses CSS grid with `auto-fit` and `minmax` to create responsive columns that adjust to screen size.
* Masonry-like wrapping with variable image heights.

### 5️⃣ **Lightbox**

* Click any image to open in fullscreen.
* Next/Previous buttons to navigate within filtered set.
* Click outside or use close (×) to dismiss.
